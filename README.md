**Task Manager with User Authentication **

Description

In today’s world, individuals often need to keep track of various tasks in a structured way. You are tasked with building a Task Manager that allows users to manage their tasks. The system should include user authentication, meaning each user has to log in with a username and password. Once logged in, users can create, view, update, and delete their tasks. Each user’s tasks should be stored separately, and only the authenticated user can access their tasks.

 

Objectives:

Design and implement a user authentication system (login and registration)
Create a task management system that allows users to :
Add, view, mark as completed, and delete tasks
Use file handling to store user credentials and tasks persistently
Create an interactive menu-driven interface to manage tasks
